      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>My name is Veliswa Zicina, and I am a student at the PLP Web Development course. This is my first assignment, and I am excited to share my progress with you.</p>
      <p>This webpage serves as a practical demonstration of my foundational knowledge and growing confidence in using HTML5. Created as part of my ongoing learning journey, it highlights my ability to structure web content effectively using semantic tags, adhere to best practices in web development, and lay the groundwork for building accessible and SEO-friendly websites. This practice page reflects not only my technical skills but also my commitment to developing clean, readable, and future-ready code.</p>

        <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the web's core language, designed to structure content more efficiently while supporting modern features like multimedia, mobile compatibility, and cleaner code. It introduces semantic tags such as header, main, and article which improve accessibility, enhance Search Engine Optimization, and make web pages easier to read and maintain.</p>
